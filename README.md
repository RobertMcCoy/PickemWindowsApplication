--REQUIRES NEWTONSOFT JSON--

Requires Steam ID, Authentication Code, and Developer API Key.

Steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/id/[YOUR STEAM ID]?xml=1

Authentication Code: https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=730&issueid=128

Developer API Key: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

Major work in progress, first JSON usage ever, so the code is pretty sloppy in some places and can probably be cleaned up, which I will do over time.

Currently the Resources.resx file is unavailable because I have my information in there, I will fix this later on.
