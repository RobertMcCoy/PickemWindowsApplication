Major work in progress, first JSON usage ever, so the code is pretty sloppy in some places and can probably be cleaned up, which I will do over time.

Currently the Resources.resx file is unavailable because I have my information in there, I will fix this later on.

# 2017 Update
Valve has removed portions of their API that this program requires to function, and they have also ripped out portions of the Fantasy Pick'Em challenge that has killed this project. The Team Selection portion should still function properly, but no guarantees.
